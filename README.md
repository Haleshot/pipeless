Pipeless ships all the features you need to create and deploy efficient computer vision applications that work in real-time.

Pipeless is inspired by modern serverless technologies to allow you write code in any language and that runs anywhere, including edge and IoT devices. Just like you implement small independent functions that react to http events for serverless web applications, with Pipeless you write functions that react to events on video frames.

You can easily use industry-standard models such as YOLO, or bring your own custom model and load it in one of the supported inference runtimes for high performance. Pipeless ships some of the most popular inference runtimes embedded, such as the ONNX Runtime, allowing you to run inference using any compatible model in CPUs and GPUs out-of-the-box.

You can deploy Pipeless into edge and IoT devices or to the cloud. We provide several tools for the deployment, including container images and Kubernetes Helm Charts.

## Requirements ‚òùÔ∏è

* Python (tested with version `3.10.12`)
* **Gstreamer 1.20.3**. Verify with `gst-launch-1.0 --gst-version`. Installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=python)

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

```console
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/main/install.sh | bash
```

Find more information and installation options [here](https://www.pipeless.ai/docs/v1/getting-started/installation).

### Using docker

Instead of installing locally, you can alternatively use docker and save the time of installing dependencies:

```console
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless --help
```

Find the whole container documentation [here](https://www.pipeless.ai/docs/v1/container).

## Getting Started üöÄ

Init a project:

```console
pipeless init my_project --template scaffold
cd my_project
```

Start Pipeless:

```console
pipeless start --stages-dir .
```

Provide a stream:

```console
pipeless add stream --input-uri "https://pipeless-public.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/cats.mp4" --output-uri "screen" --frame-path "my-stage"
```
