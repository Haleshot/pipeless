**Pipeless is an open-source framework that takes care of everything you need to develop and deploy computer vision applications in just minutes.** That includes code parallelization, multimedia pipelines, memory management, model inference, multi-stream management, and more. Pipeless allows you to **ship applications that work in real-time in minutes instead of weeks/months**.

Pipeless is inspired by modern serverless technologies. You provide some functions and Pipeless takes care of executing them for new video frames and everything involved.

With Pipeless you create self-contained boxes that we call "stages". Each stage is a micro pipeline that performs a specific task. Then, you can combine stages dynamically per stream, allowing you to process each stream with a different pipeline without changing your code and without restarting the program. To create a stage you simply provide a pre-process function, a model and a post-process function.

You can load **industry-standard models**, such as YOLO, **or custom models** in one of the supported inference runtimes just by providing a URL. Pipeless ships some of the most popular inference runtimes, such as the ONNX Runtime, allowing you to run inference with high performance on CPU or GPU out-of-the-box.

You can deploy your Pipeless and your applications to edge and IoT devices or to the cloud. There are several tools for the deployment, including container images.

The following is a **non-exhaustive** set of relevant features that Pipeless includes:

* **Multi-stream support**: process several streams at the same time.
* **Dynamic stream configuration**: add, edit, and remove streams on the fly via a CLI or REST API (more adapters to come).
* **Multi-language support**: you can Write your hooks in several languages, including Python.
* **Dynamic processing steps**: you can add any number of steps to your stream processing, and even modify those steps dynamically on a per-stream basis.
* **Built-in restart policies**: Forget about dealing with connection errors, cameras that fail, etc. You can easily specify restart policies per stream that handle those situations automatially.
* **Highly parallelized**: do not worry about multi-threading and/or multi-processing, Pipeless takes care of that for you.
* **Several inference runtimes supported**: Provide a model and select one of the supported inference runtimes to run it out-of-the-box in CPU or GPUs. We support **CUDA**, **TensorRT**, **OpenVINO**, **CoreML**, and more to come.
* **Well-defined project structure and highly reusable code**: Pipeless uses the file system structure to load processing stages and hooks, helping you organize the code in highly reusable boxes. Each stage is a directory, each hook is defined on its own file.

## Requirements ‚òùÔ∏è

* **Python**. Pre-built binaries are linked to Python 3.10 in Linux amd64, 3.8 in Linux arm64, and 3.12 in macOS. If you have a different Python version, provide the `--build` flag to the install script to build from source so Pipeless links to your installed Python version (or update your version and use a pre-built binary, which is simpler).
* **Gstreamer 1.20.3**. Verify with `gst-launch-1.0 --gst-version`. Installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=python)

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

```console
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/main/install.sh | bash
```

Find more information and installation options [here](https://www.pipeless.ai/docs/v1/getting-started/installation).

### Using docker

Instead of installing locally, you can alternatively use docker and save the time of installing dependencies:

```console
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless --help
```

To use it with CUDA:

```console
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless:latest-cuda --help
```

To use with TensorRT use:

```console
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless:latest-tensorrt --help
```

Find the whole container documentation [here](https://www.pipeless.ai/docs/v1/container).

## Getting Started üöÄ

Init a project:

```console
pipeless init my_project --template scaffold
cd my_project
```

Start Pipeless:

```console
pipeless start --stages-dir .
```

Provide a stream:

```console
pipeless add stream --input-uri "https://pipeless-public.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/cats.mp4" --output-uri "screen" --frame-path "my-stage"
```

The code generated is an empty template that scafold a stage so it will do nothing. Please go to the [examples](https://www.pipeless.ai/docs/v1/examples) to complete that stage.

You can also use the interactive shell to create the project:

## Examples üåü

You can find some examples under the `examples` directory. Just copy those folders inside your project and play with them.

Find [here](https://pipeless.ai/docs/v1/examples) the whole list of examples and step by step guides.

## Benchmark üìà

We deployed Pipeless to several different devices so you can have a general idea of its performance. Find the results at the [benchmark section](https://pipeless.ai/docs/v1/benchmark) of the docs.

## Notable Changes

Notable changes indicate important changes between versions. Please check the [whole list of notable changes](https://pipeless.ai/docs/v1/changes).
