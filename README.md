Pipeless ships all the features you need to create and deploy efficient computer vision applications that work in real-time. Pipeless is extremely flexible and it also helps you organize the code to be highly reusable.

Pipeless is inspired by modern serverless technologies to allow you write code in any language and that runs anywhere. Just like you implement small self-contained functions that react to http events when creating serverless web applications, with Pipeless you write functions that react to frames.

You can easily use industry-standard models such as YOLO, or bring your own custom model and load it in one of the supported inference runtimes for high performance. Pipeless contains a built-in ONNX Runtime, among others, allowing you to run inference using any compatible model.

You can deploy Pipeless either on edge devices or to the cloud. We provide container images and other tools, such as a Helm Chart, to deploy Pipeless with Kubernetes. Finally, we are working to leverage modern technologies allowing to deploy Pipeless applications to any kind of edge and IoT devices.

## Requirements ‚òùÔ∏è

* Python (tested with version `3.10.12`)
* **Gstreamer 1.20.3**. Verify with `gst-launch-1.0 --gst-version`. Installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=python)

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

```console
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/main/install.sh | bash
```

Find more information and installation options [here](https://www.pipeless.ai/docs/v1/getting-started/installation).

### Using docker

Instead of installing locally, you can alternatively use docker and save the time of installing dependencies:

```console
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless --help
```

Find the whole container documentation [here](https://www.pipeless.ai/docs/v1/container).

## Getting Started üöÄ

Init a project:

```console
pipeless init my_project --template scaffold
cd my_project
```

Start Pipeless:

```console
pipeless start --stages-dir .
```

Provide a stream:

```console
pipeless add stream --input-uri "https://pipeless-public.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/cats.mp4" --output-uri "screen" --frame-path "my-stage"
```
