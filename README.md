Pipeless is an open-source <b>computer vision framework</b> to create and deploy applications without the complexity of building and maintaining multimedia pipelines. It ships everything you need to create and deploy efficient computer vision applications that work in real-time in just minutes.

Pipeless is inspired by modern serverless technologies. It provides the development experience of serverless frameworks but applied to computer vision. You simply provide some functions that are executed for new video frames and Pipeless takes care of everything else.

You can easily use industry-standard models, such as YOLO, or load your custom model in one of the supported inference runtimes. Pipeless ships some of the most popular inference runtimes, such as the ONNX Runtime, allowing you to run inference with high performance either on CPU or GPU out-of-the-box.

You can deploy your Pipeless application into edge and IoT devices or to the cloud. We provide several tools for the deployment, including container images.

The following is **non-exhaustive** set of relevant features:

* **Multi-stream support**: process several streams at the same time.
* **Dynamic stream configuration**: add, edit and remove streams on the fly via a CLI or REST API (more adapters to come).
* **Multi-language support**: you can Write your hooks in several languages, including Python.
* **Dynamic processing steps**: you can add any number of steps to your stream processing, and even modify those steps dynamically.
* **Highly parallelized**: do not worry about multi-threading and/or multi-processing, Pipeless takes care of that for you.
* **Several inference runtimes supported**: Provide a model and select one of the supported inference runtimes to run it out-of-the-box in CPU or GPUs. We support **CUDA**, **TensorRT**, **OpenVINO**, **CoreML**, and more to come.
* **Well defined project structure and highly reusable code**: Pipeless uses the file system structure to load processings stages and hooks, helping you organize the code in highly reusable boxes. Each stage is a directory, each hook is defined on its own file.

## Requirements ‚òùÔ∏è

* Python. Pre-built binaries are linked to Python 3.11 in Linux and 3.12 in macOS. Just provide the `--build` flag to the install script if you have a different version (or update your version and use a pre-built binary).
* **Gstreamer 1.20.3**. Verify with `gst-launch-1.0 --gst-version`. Installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=python)

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

```console
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/main/install.sh | bash
```

Find more information and installation options [here](https://www.pipeless.ai/docs/v1/getting-started/installation).

### Using docker

Instead of installing locally, you can alternatively use docker and save the time of installing dependencies:

```console
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless --help
```

Find the whole container documentation [here](https://www.pipeless.ai/docs/v1/container).

## Getting Started üöÄ

Init a project:

```console
pipeless init my_project --template scaffold
cd my_project
```

Start Pipeless:

```console
pipeless start --stages-dir .
```

Provide a stream:

```console
pipeless add stream --input-uri "https://pipeless-public.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/cats.mp4" --output-uri "screen" --frame-path "my-stage"
```

Check the complete [getting started guide](https://pipeless.ai/docs/v1/getting-started) or plunge into the [complete documentation](https://www.pipeless.ai/docs).

## Examples üåü

You can find some examples under the `examples` directory. Just copy those folders inside your project and play with them.

Find [here](https://pipeless.ai/docs/v1/examples) the whole list of examples and step by step guides.
