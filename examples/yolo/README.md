# Pipeless plus YOLOv8 out of the box example

This example makes use of the Pipeless YOLOv8 plugin to perform object detection, segmentation and pose estimation, everything at the same time.

Depending on the YOLO model you specify, it will perform object detection only, object detection plus image segmentation or human pose estimation.

The results are drawn over the frames using the Pipeless Drawing Plugin to demonstrate its usage.
