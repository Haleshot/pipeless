# Pipeless ready to use models

This directory contains a collection of ready to use models.

They implement interfaces for the Pipeless framework, but can be used anywhere (even without using the Pipeless framework)

Every directory is a separated module containing models based on a specific framework/library. This structure helps keep Pipeless as light as possible.
